## About

HMU-map is an effort to create a quick and easy way for students to find labs and buildings on the HMU campus.

## Developing

Once you've git pulled the project and installed its dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy the app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
